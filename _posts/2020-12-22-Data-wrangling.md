## **Datasets Used in This Project**

- **Philadelphia Crime Data (by OpenDataPhilly)**
- **Weather data (by WorldWeatherOnline)**
- **Census tracts data (by the U.S. Census Bureau)**

We accessed the API documentation from **OpenDataPhilly** to load the **Crime Incidents data** and then we removed data that do not contain location information.    
   
```python
API_endpoint = "https://phl.carto.com/api/v2/sql"
# the query
query = "SELECT * FROM incidents_part1_part2 WHERE dispatch_date_time >= '2015-01-01' AND dispatch_date_time < '2020-12-01'" 
output_format = 'geojson'
params = dict(q=query, format=output_format)
r = requests.get(API_endpoint, params=params)
features = r.json()
crime = gpd.GeoDataFrame.from_features(features)
```

Also, we loaded **Weather data** (from 2015 to present) by using the [wwo-hist package](https://github.com/ekapope/WorldWeatherOnline), a WorldWeatherOnline historical weather data API wrapper. We added a new field Diff_temp (Diff_temp= maxtempC-mintempC) into our weather dataset.    
```python
from wwo_hist import retrieve_hist_data
import os
os.chdir("your own path")
frequency = 12
start_date = '1-1-2015'
end_date = '12-1-2020'
api_key = 'your own api key'
location_list = ['philadelphia']
hist_weather_data = retrieve_hist_data(api_key,
                          location_list,
                          start_date,
                          end_date,
                          frequency,
                          location_label = False,
                          export_csv = True,
                          store_df = True)
```

We also query **Census data** from **the U.S. Census Bureau** for demographic data, we got total population, white residents population, median household income and median contract rent data. We then added a new field Pct_White (Pct_White=white residents population/total population) into our demographic dataset. 

```python
acs = cenpy.remote.APIConnection("ACSDT5Y2018")
variables = [
    "NAME",
    "B02001_001E", # Total population
    "B02001_002E", #White residents population
    "B19001_001E", #Median household income
    "B25058_001E", #Median contract rent ]
    
philly_demo_data = acs.query(
    cols=variables,
    geo_unit="block group:*",
    geo_filter={"state": "42", 
                "county": "101", 
                "tract": "*"},)
                
# Use SQL to return geometries only for Philadelphia County in PA
where_clause = f"STATE = {42} AND COUNTY = {101}"

# Query for block groups
philly_block_groups = acs.mapservice.layers[10].query(where=where_clause)
philly_demo_final = philly_block_groups.merge(
    philly_demo_data,
    left_on=["STATE", "COUNTY", "TRACT", "BLKGRP"],
    right_on=["state", "county", "tract", "block group"],)
```

**We removed data that did not contain location information, and adjusted the projection of them. We spatially joined the crime incidents data with demographic data by census tractsâ€™ location, and then joined weather data by date time to get our final dataframe.**

## **Feature engineering**

For our final datasets, the following 20 featured attributes are included:   

- **DC_Dist**	: A two character field that names the District boundary.	   
- **DC_Key**	: The unique identifier of the crime that consists of Year + District + Unique ID.   
- **Dispatch_Date_Time**	: The date and time that the officer was dispatched to the scene.   	
- **Hour**	: The generalized hour of the dispatched time.	   
- **Location_Block**	: The location of crime generalized by street block.   
- **Tract** : Census tracts.   
- **PSA**	: A single character field that names the Police Service Area boundary.	   
- **Text_General_Code**	: General Crime Category	The generalized text for the crime code.   
- **Text_general**	: General Crime Category	The generalized text for the crime code.   
- **Total population**  Total population.   
- **White residents population** : White residents population.   
- **Pct_White** : Pct_White = white residents population/total population.   
- **Median household income** : Median household income.   
- **Median contract rent** : Median contract rent.   
- **Geometry** : Geometry.   
- **tempC** : Day temperature.   
- **maxtempC** :Max temperature.   
- **mintempC**: : Min temperature.   
- **FeelsLikeC** : Feels like temperature.   
- **Diff_temp** : Diff_temp = maxtempC - mintempC.
