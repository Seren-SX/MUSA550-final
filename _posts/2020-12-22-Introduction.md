With a crime rate of 40 per one thousand residents, Philadelphia has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes - from the smallest towns to the very largest cities. One's chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime here is one in 25. Within Pennsylvania, more than 98% of the communities have a lower crime rate than Philadelphia. In fact, after researching dangerous places to live, NeighborhoodScout found Philadelphia to be one of the top 100 most dangerous cities in the U.S.A.   
     
High crime rate and tight policing budgets are increasing demand for more efficient law-enforcement technologies, and here is where we turn to data science for help. Data science is an ideal planning tool to ensure that the supply of a limited resource (e.g. policing), matches the demand for those resources (e.g. crime).  
     
This project aims to build a “predictive policing” system in order to “do more with less.”, to use machine learning algorithms to predict crime distribution in Philadelphia, and provide recommendations for the allocation of police resources.
   
The data used in this project are mainly from [OpenDataPhilly](https://www.opendataphilly.org/), [WorldWeatherOnline](http://www.worldweatheronline.com/) and the[U.S. Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/).
   
Generally, this project would be divided into 4 parts:
- Introduction
- Data wrangling
- Exploratory Analysis & Visualization
- Prediction & More
